//! The "local interpolation context" describes the processor's part of the source NetCDF
//! file (for regridding).
/*! The local interpolation context contains the details of how the processor's block of
  the new computational domain fits into the domain of the netCDF file. Note that each
  vertical column of the grid is owned by exactly one processor.

  For any particular dimension, we have a new computational domain \f$[a,b]\f$ with
  spacing \f$h\f$ so there are \f$n = (b - a) / h\f$ interior cells, indexed by \f$\{i_0, \dots, i_n\}\f$.
  The local processor owns a range \f$\{i_m, \dots, i_{m'}\}\f$.  Suppose the netCDF file has
  domain \f$[A,B]\f$, spacing \f$H\f$, and \f$N = (B - A) / H\f$ cells.  In order to interpolate
  onto these points, we need the indices \f$\{I_m, \dots, I_{m'}\}\f$ of the netCDF file so that

  \f[  [x(i_m), x(i_{m'})] \quad \text{is a subset of} \quad  [x(I_m), x(I_{m'})]  \f]

  The arrays `start` and `count` have 4 integer entries, corresponding to the dimensions
  `t, x, y, z(zb)`.
